# Heaps-Man

Heaps-Man is a Pac-Man clone I made to learn a bit of the Haxe language and the Heaps engine.

It's bad coding but it works. It's not a 1:1 clone but it's a pretty faithful one, minus the exact speeds and timings, I didn't add any of the progression mechanics. I know sometimes collisions seem to not be working, but that's also part of the design of the original.

I enjoyed making it a lot, I hope you enjoy reading my spaghetti code and playing it.
